# Python Live Trading Bot

## Summary
This live trading bot uses a clear and uncomplicated approach to evaluate real-time market data and produce long and short signals based on the High, Low, Open, and Close values of the last three candles. It was developed using Python code and integrates the Oanda API, Yahoo Finance, and Pandas. The bot's goal is to automate the process of taking positions in the market by utilizing engulfing patterns as entry triggers. It is made to adapt to different financial instruments. For example, a long position is indicated if the current candle opens below the two preceding candles and closes above them; a short position is indicated if the candle opens above and closes below. And an automated trade will be made. This is not financial advise.
