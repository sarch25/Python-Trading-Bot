# Python Live Trading Bot

## Objective
This live trading bot uses a clear and uncomplicated approach to evaluate real-time market data and produce long and short signals based on the High, Low, Open, and Close values of the last three candles. It was developed using Python code and integrates the Oanda API, Yahoo Finance, and Pandas. The bot's goal is to automate the process of taking positions in the market by utilizing engulfing patterns as entry triggers. It is made to adapt to different financial instruments. For example, a long position is indicated if the current candle opens below the two preceding candles and closes above them; a short position is indicated if the candle opens above and closes below. And an automated trade will be made. This is not financial advise.

### Skills Learned

- Integration of APIs and financial data sources for market analysis and trade execution
- Application of technical analysis concepts into Python code, such as engulfing patterns, for generating trading signals
- Automation of trading processes to streamline the execution of trades based on predefined strategies
- Adaptation of trading strategies to different financial instruments, allowing for versatility and scalability

### Tools Used

- Python: Programming language used for coding the trading bot
- Oanda API: Brokerage API utilized for accessing market data and executing trades
- Yahoo Finance: Source of financial market data used for analysis
- Pandas: Python library used for data manipulation and analysis
